What happened?,You don’t remember? I’d think a barkeep would know how to hold their liquor a little better.,,StartToutorial,,,1,1
Ugh...,I don't think I've seen you down that much in 30 years. Remember that night at the lion’s head? Me neither.,StartToutorial,GotVeryDrunk,,,1,1
What happened?,"Well, as I remember it, I helped you clean up, we decided to stay late and have a couple of drinks. After that… it all gets a little fuzzy. Considering it’s almost time for you to open again, I don’t suppose you’d be willing to mix me a drink?",GotVeryDrunk,MixDrink,,,1,1
A drink?,"Still a little drunk, eh? You have the recipe in your book there. But before you get to mixing, I should tell you that you may have misplaced some things last night. I can't find you cleaning supplies anywhere.",MixDrink,Misplaced,,,1,1
Do you remember where?,I don't remember much after my first three Constantine Specials. I do know we sat at that table there.,Misplaced,SatTable,,,1,
Is this some sort of prank? Where did you put them?,I don't remember much after my first three Constantine Specials. I do know we sat at that table there.,Misplaced,SatTable,,,1,1
,*you can keep track of what you know with the mystery board*,SatTable,Board,,,1,1
What else do you remember?,"Hm… we talked a lot about the old days, before your injury. You were under the table for a bit *laughs*",Board,OldDays,,,1,1
Old days?,"Oh, don’t make me talk about adventuring. I get tired just thinking about it. Regardless, I looked under the table. Nothing but some keys. I hung them over there with the rest.",OldDays,KeysHook,,,1,1
The keys go to the rooms. Maybe we went there. Do you remember which key it was?,"No idea. Just put them on the empty hook. I don’t remember going to the rooms, though anything could’ve happened after that fourth drink. ",KeysHook,VeryVeryDrunk,,,1,1
Pretty far gone?,"Yep. You tried to clean up a few spills, but I think you just spilled the cleaning solution everywhere. Say, where do you keep your backup solution?",VeryVeryDrunk,BackupSolution,,,1,1
The supplies must be there!,,BackupSolution,EndToutorial,,,1,1
"You seem nervous, what's bothering you?","Oh, you know, old things. Just been thinking a lot lately.",EndToutorial,ConstOldTimes,,,1,1
Thinking about what?,"Back in Ravenwood - I still haven't gotten over it. We were sent to rescue them, and I killed them. I know, it was an accident, but we lied, blamed the kidnappers. We were wrong, and we knew it. It's been twenty five years and I still think about it. Do you think we would have ever succeeded if we didn't? All of our careers started with a lie.",ConstOldTimes,RavenwoodAccident,,,1,1
How have things been going lately?,"Things have been improving at the bank since the theft last month. I don't think the guard has caught the thief yet, though. Wish I did when I had the chance. If I ever see him again, I swear, he's done for.",RavenwoodAccident,BankRobbery,,,1,1
What was the robber like?,"Unremarkable, really. He was skinny, I guess. Black hair. Big ears, sort of.",BankRobbery,RobberDesc,,,1,1
"Bar's closing, Constantine. You've got to get home","I know, I know. Would it really be so bad if I stayed a while longer? I just want to sit and think, alone. ",RobberDesc,StayTheNight,,,1,1
"Alright, man. Don't make a mess of things. ",Thanks. Goodnight.,StayTheNight,,,,1,1
